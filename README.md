# React from my POV

### Agenda
1) **Intro**
  - I'm not an expert. If you need an expert contact @michelebertoli
  - I don't know the internals details
  - I'm not on the edge with tooling
  - I'm a `no-framework` sustainer
  - Principles!

2) **An intro to the reactjs world**
  - The idea of reactjs 
    - Composition
    - Functional approach
  - Create a component (branch `intro`)
    - createClass/extends  
    - Rendering
    - Attach to the dom
    - Properties
    - State management
      - `demo` write a click counter
    - Component lifecycle

3) **A better approach (branch `redux`)**
  - Don't mess with state 
  - Dummy components vs Smart components
  - Components as functions
  - Redux pattern
  - Refactoring to redux implementation

4) **Tooling**
  - Setup and tools
    - npm
    - web pack
        - basic configuration
        - babel
        - plugins
        - environment
    - scss
    - vendor vs app
    - dev vs prod
    - hot reload
  - Testing

5) **A real world application (branch `master`)**
  - A spotify client
    - Search for an artist
    - Show the artists
    - Show the albumns of that artist
    - Add the album to the basket
